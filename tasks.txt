-run the .rb file. have it say something. make the user choose
something, then drop into the eval loop.
-after the user chooses a task (as stipulated above), he must type code
and then call a special function to determine whether or not he has
completed the current task.
-if the task is complete, we say woop dee doo and we drop back
into the menu to have the guy choose another task to complete 

TODO
--restructure this so it doesn't look like blown chunks
--TESTS


NOTES (and maybe a haiku here and there)
--irb_print_working_workspace returns the current object... can use this to 
attach the methods i need, instead of spamming the Object class with crap.
--use dynamic dispatch to define the methods only on the main object.

--computer is bad
--listen, laptop: Y U MEAN?
--i am disappoint.
